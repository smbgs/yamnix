# Yamnix python modules

Yamnix Python uses Poetry to manage environments and 
dependencies.

To use Yamnix libraries and tooling please 

1. Follow the ([Poetry installation instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation))

2. Install the appropriate extensions for your favorite IDE:
   
   - [Poetry - Plugins | JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14307-poetry)
     
     - Note: Create modules from existing sources rather than creating python modules and setting up SDK, otherwise plugin seems to be causing IDE to crash sometimes.
   1. [VSCode Â· Issue #8372](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/issues/8372)
   2. If you prefer something else - you can just use [Poetry Shell](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#shell)
